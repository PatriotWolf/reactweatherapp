## Note
This repo just to demonstrate of react skill with boilerplate.<br />

## What I've done
1) get user coordinates and dispatch an action to store the coordinates.
2) After dispatching, saga will yield the value so that we can obtain weather with given api.
3) Component of a div in form of card will be displayed if request success.
4) passing props in a stateless component and display weather.
5) Using Bootstrap SCSS

## Quick start

1.  Make sure that you have Node.js v8.10 and npm v5 or above installed.
2.  Install all package dependencies with `npm install`
3.  At this point you can run `npm start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3000`._

Now you're ready to rumble!
